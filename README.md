# HateSpeech_Detection
This project is a data science project that aims to develop a model for detecting hate speech in text.

## Project Description
Hate speech is a serious problem that can have a negative impact on individuals and society as a whole. It is important to be able to detect hate speech so that it can be addressed. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately detect hate speech in text.

The project uses a Jupyter notebook to train and test the model. The notebook is available in the .ipynb file. The notebook loads the dataset from the .csv file and then trains the model using a variety of machine learning techniques. The model is then tested on a separate dataset of text to evaluate its accuracy.

The project is still under development, but it has achieved promising results so far. The model has been able to accurately detect hate speech with an accuracy of over 87%.

## How to Use the Project
The project is available on GitHub. To use the project, you will need to clone the repository to your computer. Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook will walk you through the steps of training and testing the model.

## Project Files
The project contains the following files:

README.md - This file provides a description of the project.
Hate Speech Detection-checkpoint.ipynb - This Jupyter notebook trains and tests the model.
data.csv - This CSV file contains the dataset that is used to train and test the model.
